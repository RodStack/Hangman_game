# Hangman_game
It's the classic hangman but coded in python 
The Hangman game randomly selects a word and displays the number of letters in that word as underscores. 
The player must guess letters to reveal the word, with each incorrect guess resulting in the drawing of a hangman. 
The player can guess until either the word is revealed, in which case they win, or the hangman is fully drawn, in which case they lose. 
The player has a total of 6 incorrect guesses allowed before losing the game.
